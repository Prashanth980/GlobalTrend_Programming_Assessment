Global Trend Programming Profile Assessment Questions

1. **Implement a Python class MaxHeap**: Implement a max-heap data structure supporting operations like insert, delete, and get_max while maintaining the max-heap properties.
   
2. **Write a Python function to handle URL downloads with retries**: Write a function that takes a list of URLs, attempts to download their content, and retries up to 3 times if an error occurs. Use appropriate error handling to manage different types of exceptions.
   
3. **Train a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn**: Write a Python script that trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn. Use a dataset of your choice, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance.
   
4. **Clean and preprocess a DataFrame using pandas**: Write a Python function that cleans and preprocesses a given DataFrame, handling missing values, normalizing numerical columns, and encoding categorical columns using pandas.

5. **Compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion**: Write a Python function that computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

6. **Handle division with zero using custom error message**: Write a Python function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.

7. **Write a Python decorator to measure execution time**: Write a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.

8. **Perform arithmetic operations based on user input**: Write a Python function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

9. **Generate a random password**: Write a Python function that generates a random password containing a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

10. **Transpose a 2D list (matrix)**: Write a Python function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.
