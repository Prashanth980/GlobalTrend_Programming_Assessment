Write a Python function that takes a list of URLs, attempts to download their content, and retries up to 3 times if an error occurs. Use appropriate error handling to manage different types of exceptions.
Write a Python script that trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn. Use a dataset of your choice, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance.
Using pandas, write a Python function to clean and preprocess a given DataFrame, which involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical columns, and encoding categorical columns.
Write a Python function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
Write a Python function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.
Write a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.
